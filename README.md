# ðŸ’¼ HOTEL MANAGEMENT WITH ODOO

The goal is to create a web platform to enable room reservations for guestsðŸ‘©. Guests can book rooms for a specific period of time and then vacate the room at the end.
For this purpose, room management will be done through the back office, but guests can only log in via the website, meaning that reservations will be made through the website.
